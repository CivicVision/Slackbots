# Toggl Weekly

It's a Slack Bot for retrieving the weekly total of hours worked for the specified workspace. 

You can clone it here: [https://open.blockspring.com/milafrerichs/ec578f5705b95b7c7c6446ddc354cde4](https://open.blockspring.com/milafrerichs/ec578f5705b95b7c7c6446ddc354cde4)

There is just one command for now:

It returns the current weeks total:
